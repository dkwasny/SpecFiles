SpecFiles
=========

A set of RPM spec files that are used to create the RPMs used in my [PuppetConfig repo](https://github.com/dkwasny/PuppetConfig).

Since my main goal is to repackage binary tarballs into RPMs for the sake of Puppet, these spec files will be rather simplistic in nature.  Little to no source compilation will be done.
